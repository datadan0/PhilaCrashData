# Philly Auto Crash Data Analysis

Stages of analysis:\
[Data preparation](https://github.com/datadan0/phila-auto-crash/blob/main/01_phila_crashes_data_prep.ipynb) - comparing and appending data sets and decoding variables\
[Exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/datadan0/phila-auto-crash/blob/main/02_explore_data.ipynb) - IN PROGRESS - checking a few sample events in the data set, checking frequencies of values\
To do:
- Data analysis - possible areas to explore:
  - Did the speed cameras (installed in 2020) on the Roosevelt Boulevard (Route 1) reduce accidents?  Did they reduce fatalities?
  - Is there a difference in accident concentration between snowy weather and dry weather?
  - Are [firehouses (with ambulance)](https://www.phila.gov/services/safety-emergency-preparedness/fire-safety/find-a-fire-station/) located close to serious crash epicenters?  Is this visible in emergency response time statistics?
  - What are the ages of drivers with cell phone related accidents?
  - Are drunk driving accidents increasing or decreasing?
